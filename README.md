# üìç WebSocket Tracking App

A simple Android application that uses **WebSocket** to send **device location (GPS)** data to a server. The location is obtained in the background using a **foreground service**, and transmitted to the server every few seconds via WebSocket.

## üõ∞Ô∏è How it Works

1. When the user taps "Start", the `LocationService` foreground service is launched.
2. The device‚Äôs current location is retrieved every 5 seconds.
3. The location is sent to the WebSocket server as a simple message.
4. If the WebSocket connection fails, it will automatically attempt to reconnect.
5. The user can stop tracking by pressing the "Stop" button.

## üîß Configuration

You can change the WebSocket URL in the `WebSocketManager.kt` file:

```kotlin
val request = Request.Builder()
    .url("wss://echo.websocket.events") // Replace with your WebSocket server
    .build()
